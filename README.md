Facial Expression Recognition
==============================

The objective of this project is to analyze image dataset containing images of facial expressions, train a model to extract features from the images and classifiy the facial expression in a given image.

## Tools Used:
##### Python
##### Jupyter Notebook
##### Git

## Python libraries
##### sklearn
##### torch
##### numpy
##### os
##### tensorflow
##### matplotlib

## Information about the data:
The given data contains the images of faces and labels for facial expressions. The data consists of 7 unique expression classes and about 40,000 images of size 48x48 in grayscale.

## Problem Statement
Classifying the images in correct class of facial expressions.

## Models And their Evaluation:
##### Logestic Regression for Binary Classification with 2 expressions: Achieved 84.7% accuracy in predicting the expression class.
##### Logestic Regression for Multiclass Classification: Achieved 25.7% test and 27% train accuracy in predicting the expression class.
##### ANN: Achieved about 15% test and 15% train accuracy in predicting the expression class.
##### CNN using PyTorch: Achieved about 49% test and 85% train accuracy in predicting the expression class.

## Conclusion:
PyTorch-CNN with LeNet architecture with ADAM, one dropout layer, and batch gradient descent outperforms other models.
Hyperparamters to be adjusted and new architectures to be tried.
